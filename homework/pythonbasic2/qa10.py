# 10) String characters balance Test

# We’ll say that a String s1 and s2 is balanced if all the chars in the string1 are there in s2.
#  characters position doesn’t matter.

# For Example: –

# stringBalanceCheck(yn, Pynative) = True

s1 = "h"

s2 = "hello"

if s1 in s2:

    print(f"{s1} is in {s2}. So it is balanced.")

else:

    print(f"{s1} is not in {s2}. So it is not balanced.")

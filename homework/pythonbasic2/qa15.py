For Example: sampleList = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]

Expected Outcome:
Original list  [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]

Chunk  1 [11, 45, 8]

After reversing it  [8, 45, 11]

Chunk  2 [23, 14, 12]

After reversing it  [12, 14, 23]

Chunk  3 [78, 45, 89]

After reversing it  [89, 45, 78]

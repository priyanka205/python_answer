#  Iterate a given list and Check if a given element already exists in a dictionary as
#   a keyâ€™s value if not delete it from the list
# Given:
# rollNumber = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
# sampleDict ={'Jhon':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}
# Expected Outcome:after removing unwanted elemnts from list [47, 69, 76, 97]

The file "MerchandiseData.csv" contains inventory of fruits with following variables.
Item,UnitCostPrice,Count,TotalSellPrice

Step 01: 
Calculate the following for each item before doing any programming.
	TotalCostPrice
	UnitSellPrice
	Profit-LossAmount (if loss was incurred the value should be negative)

and write it in a new file "MerchandiseData_Profit_and_Loss_Statement_Manual.csv" with following headers

Item,UnitCostPrice,TotalCostPrice,Count,UnitSellPrice,TotalSellPrice,Profit-LossAmount


Step 02:
Write a python program to calculate what you calculated in Step01 
	and create an output file "MerchandiseData_Profit_and_Loss_Statement_using_Python.csv"

with following headers
Item,UnitCostPrice,TotalCostPrice,Count,UnitSellPrice,TotalSellPrice,Profit-LossAmount


Following are the requirements for writing python script:
- use python 3.6 and higher
- use no external libraries
- use no functions (just a single plain python file)
- write comment on blocks of code explaining what it is doing
- keep the original file as it is
- Create a new file named "MerchandiseData_Profit_and_Loss_Statement_using_Python.csv"  that contains the following
	Item,UnitCostPrice,TotalCostPrice,Count,UnitSellPrice,TotalSellPrice,Profit-LossAmount


Step 03:
Compare the output from Step01 and Step02.
Note: the results should be the same between two files that were generated manually vs programmatically.
